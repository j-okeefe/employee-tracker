# Employee Tracker

## Description:

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, my challenge was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Technologies Used:

- Javascript
- Node
- NPM Package

- cTable

## Installation & Use:

Command line:
- npm i
- npm i inquirer
- npm i mysql
- npm install console.table --save

To start the server:
- node index.js
